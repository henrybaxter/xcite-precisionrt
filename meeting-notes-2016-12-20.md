switch to 30cm collimator to skin
get the absolute physical dose
	200mA * 30 minutes * 60 s/min * 1 / 1.602*10^-19 (coulombs per electron) 
	 2.2472e+21
	 hopefully ~15 grays


30cm collimator to skin
1 row
3 rows


we have very few shots at this:

1, 2, 4 cm target widths
x
.02, .05 septa widths
x
1 row, 3 rows, 5 rows

get the simulations running soon.

worry about the details after

egs1 has .25cm beam
egs2 has .5cm beam

the hash will be different, it won't be a problem i'm sure...
let's start a 3 row collimator

run a 1 row collimator and a 3 row collimator
run .02 septa and .05 septa of 1 row collimator
run
