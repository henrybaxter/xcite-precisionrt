# this is the master document of all simulations
# ideally all of them are completely defined by this file
# for ease of development/fixes, there are sub components that are largely separate:
# - simulations can run using a simulation.toml
# - grace plots can be generated using grace.toml
# - collimators can be generated using collimator.toml
# - collimators can be used directly with collimator = "path.egsinp"
# - scad screenshots can be used directly with scad.toml
