- fix the weighting optimization - use skin to target
- show skin to target ratio in the report
- upload the reports in toml
- upload plots (for summary reports)
- summary should show same pages, but side-by-side
- proper ct!
- what about a better phantom? i mean, these dose distributions
- only two files for configuration (sim defaults and sim)
- no magical changes to files
- always upload the claim, not just sometimes
- conformity indices

- hours!
